To run program:
	py .\wormy

THROWING STONES NOTE:
One of the things that I implemented was a throw stones feature that can be quite annoying 
if you're trying to test all aspects of the code. The program will start throwing stones to 
trip up the snakes once one or both of them get to a length past 10. To turn this off just
comment out lines 302-306. 

BULLET TO THE HEAD NOTE:
I implemented a feature so that if the snake get hit in the head with a bullet they just die.
If they get hit in the body they loose pieces and drop a stone like the original instructions.
